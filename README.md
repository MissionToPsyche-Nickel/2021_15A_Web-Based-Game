# Survive to Psyche (NASA Web Based Game 15A 2020 ASU)

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a game for the NASA Psyche mission, a mission with the purpose of sending a satellite to the Psyche 16 asteroid to research the world theorized to be made of metal. The game should engage the audience and teach them about the mission in order to get them more involved and interested. This is done by having users go through challenging yet fun gameplay with a trivia aspect for the players to learn.
